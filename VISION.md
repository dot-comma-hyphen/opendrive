VISION.md: Project Goals & User Profile

This document outlines the high-level vision, target audience, and guiding principles for the "OpenDrive" project. It serves as a compass for development decisions, ensuring the software stays true to its core purpose.
1. The Vision Statement

To create the definitive, "set it and forget it" Google Drive client for the Linux desktop.

Our vision is to provide Linux users with a native, reliable, and resource-efficient file synchronization tool that feels like a first-party application. It should be powerful enough for technical users who demand fine-grained control, yet simple and intuitive for newcomers who just want their files to be available everywhere. We are building the tool we wish we had: one that respects user privacy, integrates seamlessly with the open-source ecosystem, and is built on a foundation of modern, secure technology (C++).
2. Target Audience

We are building this for two primary groups of users within the Linux community.
Primary Audience: The Everyday Linux User

    Who they are: Students, professionals, and hobbyists using Linux desktops (GNOME, KDE, XFCE, etc.) on major distributions like Ubuntu, Fedora, or Arch Linux.

    Their Needs: They require a simple, reliable way to sync their Google Drive files for school, work, or personal projects. They are comfortable with graphical applications and expect a straightforward, one-time setup process. They value stability and low system resource usage.

    Their Goal: To have their Google Drive folder "just work" without constant intervention, similar to the experience on Windows or macOS.

Secondary Audience: The Power User / Developer

    Who they are: System administrators, software developers, and tinkerers who are highly comfortable with the command line and may be running headless servers.

    Their Needs: They require granular control over the synchronization process. They want to be able to script interactions, check status from a terminal, run the sync service on a server without a GUI, and potentially integrate it into their custom workflows.

    Their Goal: To have a robust, scriptable, and transparent tool that they can trust to manage their files and adapt to their specific needs.

3. Guiding Principles

These principles will guide our design and development choices:

    Reliability First: The synchronization engine must be robust. Users should never have to worry about silent failures or data loss. The application must handle edge cases (network loss, API errors, file conflicts) gracefully.

    Performance & Efficiency: As a background service, OpenDrive must have a minimal footprint on system resources (CPU, memory, network). It should be written in a way that is fast and avoids unnecessary work.

    Native Integration: The application should feel at home on the Linux desktop. This means adhering to platform conventions, using system tray icons, providing file manager integration, and using standard communication protocols like D-Bus.

    Simplicity through Abstraction: The user interface (both GUI and CLI) should be clean and easy to understand. The underlying complexity of the sync logic should be hidden from the user unless they explicitly ask for more detail.

    Transparency & Control: While simple on the surface, the application must provide users with clear insight into what it's doing. Users should be able to view logs, check sync status, and configure settings (like selective sync and bandwidth limits) to fit their needs.

    Open and Extensible: The project is open-source not just in license but in spirit. The architecture should be modular to allow for future expansion (e.g., adding support for other cloud services) and community contributions.
